## Positions 

- Postdoctoral Researcher at the **[Oxford Centre for Human Brain Activity - University of Oxford]([https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/](https://www.win.ox.ac.uk/about/our-locations/OHBA))**

- Honorary Researcher - **[Department of Imaging Neuroscience, UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ion/research/research-departments/department-imaging-neuroscience)**

## Research
My research uses wearable OPM-MEG to investigate brain activity in real-world, naturalistic settings. I develop novel scanning setups and analysis pipelines to extract high-level insights from complex neural datasets.

I am particularly interested in the neuroscience of social interaction and communication, and the role of synchronised neural oscillations during two-way exchanges. This involves scanning developing neurotypical participants as well as autistic participants, with the aim of understanding more about social interaction in neurodivergent populations. 

Additionally, I am interested in the use of virtual and augmented reality in neuroscience research. During my postdoc at UCL we pioneered the use of OPM-MEG in combination with virtual reality to study the neural basis of autobiographical memory encoding.
