- **Seymour, R. A.,** Alexander, N., & Maguire, E. A. (2022). Robust estimation of 1/f activity improves oscillatory burst detection. [European Journal of Neuroscience, 1â€“ 17.](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.15829)

*An improved method for detecting oscillatory bursts by estimating background 1/f activity more accurately.*

- **Seymour, R. A.,** Alexander, N., Mellor, S., O'Neill, G. C., Tierney, T. M., Barnes, G. R., & Maguire, E. A. (2021). Interference suppression techniques for OPM-based MEG: Opportunities and challenges. [NeuroImage, 118834.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118834)

*A tutorial-based review on issues with interference (noise) in wearable OPM-MEG recordings and how to fix these issues. We focus on software-based interference suppression and include two detailed tutorials.*

- **Seymour, R. A.,** Alexander, N., Mellor, S. J., O'Neill, G. C., Tierney, T. M., Barnes, G. R., & Maguire, E. A. (2021). Using OPMs to measure neural activity in standing, mobile participants. [Neuroimage.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118604)

*We show how wearable OPM-MEG can be used to measure neural activity while participants are standing and freely moving their head.*

- **Seymour, R. A.,** Rippon, G., Gooding-Williams, G., Sowman, P. F., & Kessler, K. (2020). Reduced auditory steady state responses in autism spectrum disorder. [Molecular autism, 11(1), 1-13.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13229-020-00357-y)

*Using MEG we show that autistic adolescents have reduced auditory steady-state responses at 40 Hz.*

- **Seymour, R. A.,** Rippon, G., Gooding-Williams, G., Schoffelen, J. M., & Kessler, K. (2019). Dysregulated oscillatory connectivity in the visual system in autism spectrum disorder. [Brain, 142(10), 3294-3305.](https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awz214)

*Visual connectivity was examined in autistic adolescents using a simple grating stimulus. We found both reduced feedback connectivity and dysregulated local processing. Our results have implications for sensory sensitivities in autism and link to predictive-coding accounts of perception.*

*Various methods for measuring Phase Amplitude Coupling (PAC) are reviewed and compared using simulated data and real MEG recordings. Practical recommendations for PAC analyis are given.*
