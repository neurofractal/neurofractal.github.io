- **Guest Lecturer, UCL Masters Course: The Hippocampus and Memory (2023-2024)**

    I delivered a 2hr lecture discussing autobiographical memory and the role of the hippocampus. I also set an essay question, marked the essays according to course criteria and provided critical feedback. 

- **UCL Methods for Dummies (2021-2024)**

    I have been the neuroimaging expert researcher for statistics and M/EEG source analysis. My role was to provide critical feedback to students delivering the talk and to help select reading materials for the course.

- **Co-convener Macquarie University MEG Workshop (2017-2019)**

    This course taught advanced MEG neuroimaging analysis skills to students and researchers from Australian universities. I organised coding demonstrations and delivered lectures on the course.

- **High-level Teaching Assistant (2013-2014)**

    I worked as a teaching assistant to Sixth Form students at the Cherwell School, Oxford. I helped deliver psychology classes and study skills sessions, with particular focus on developing strategies for students with special educational needs.
