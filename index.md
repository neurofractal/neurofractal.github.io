Hello, I am a cognitive neuroscience post-doctoral researcher [Macquarie University](https://www.mq.edu.au/). I previously completed my cotutelle PhD at [Aston University](http://www.aston.ac.uk/lhs/research/centres-facilities/brain-centre/) and [Macquarie University](https://www.mq.edu.au/), researching brain connectivity in autism using [magnetoencephalography (MEG)](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Magnetoencephalogram). 

I am especially interested in [autism](http://www.autism.org.uk/about/what-is.aspx), developmental neuroscience and the dynamics of whole brain cortical activity, with a focus on the application of novel analysis methods to clinical datasets.

I am also an advocate of [open science](https://elifesciences.org/content/5/e16800?utm_campaign=BMC40104U&utm_medium=BMCemail&utm_source=Teradata) & aim to share all data and code whenever possible.

## Active Projects

* **MEG studies of atypical cortical activity in autism** <br />

  * Brain oscillations and connectivity in autism spectrum disorders (ASD): new approaches to methodology, measurement and modelling. [Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews, 71, 601-620.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763416303530)

  * Investigating perspective-taking abilities in adolescents with and without autism using MEG.
  
  * Mismatch Negativity (MMN) Responses in Children & Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder
  
  * More broadly, I am interested in relating predictive-coding to patterns of brain connectivity and hierchical Bayesian inference in autism.

* **The (Reliable) Detection of Phase Amplitude Coupling During Sensory Processing** 
    * [Pre-print available on BioRxiv](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/13/163006?%3Fcollection=)
    * [Code available on Github](https://github.com/neurofractal/sensory_PAC)

* **Investigating Developmental Changes in MEG Resting-State Connectivity** 

    * Working with [Dr. Wei He](https://www.cogsci.mq.edu.au/members/profile.php?memberID=643), I will be collecting and analysing resting-state MEG data from children aged 3-6 years old. Our aim is to investigate developmental changes in oscillation-based functional connectivity.

  Recently, I have started a **Github** account, [@neurofractal](https://github.com/neurofractal), where I share MEG data analysis code and psychology experiments I have coded in [Psychopy](http://www.psychopy.org/).

I also blog very infrequently about neuroscience, computing and cool paper graphics. [LINK](http://neurofractal.tumblr.com/)

## Software Devlopment/Use

I am proficient in **[MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)** and **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** and I'm slowly trying to learn HTML! I work with several different programs/libraries including:

* **[Fieldtrip Toolbox](http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/) for MEG data analysis**
* Custom MATLAB code for the calculation of [Phase Amplitude Coupling (PAC)](http://neurofractal.tumblr.com/post/137022821953/phase-amplitude-coupling-pac-a-mechanism-for)
* **[Psychopy](http://www.psychopy.org/) for programming psychology experiments**
* [Eprime](https://www.pstnet.com/eprime.cfm) for programming psychology experiments
* Scientific Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, plotly) for psychology/behavioural data analysis and presentation
* Machine Learning (novice user of scikit-learn and tensorflow)
