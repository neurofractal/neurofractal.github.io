Hello, I am a cotutelle PhD student at [Aston University](http://www.aston.ac.uk/lhs/research/centres-facilities/brain-centre/) and [Macquarie University](https://www.mq.edu.au/), researching brain connectivity in autism using [magnetoencephalography (MEG)](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Magnetoencephalogram). 

I am especially interested in [autism](http://www.autism.org.uk/about/what-is.aspx), developmental neuroscience and the dynamics of whole brain cortical activity, with a focus on the application of novel analysis methods to clinical datasets.

I am also an advocate of [open science](https://elifesciences.org/content/5/e16800?utm_campaign=BMC40104U&utm_medium=BMCemail&utm_source=Teradata) & aim to share all data and code whenever possible.

  Recently, I have started a **Github** account, [@neurofractal](https://github.com/neurofractal), where I share MEG data analysis code and psychology experiments I have coded in [Psychopy](http://www.psychopy.org/).

I also blog very infrequently about neuroscience, computing and cool paper graphics. [LINK](http://neurofractal.tumblr.com/)

## Software Devlopment/Use

I have always been fascinated by computers and their application in solving real-world problems. I am proficient in **[MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)** and **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** and I'm slowly trying to learn HTML! I work with several different programs/libraries including:

* **[Fieldtrip Toolbox](http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/) for MEG data analysis**
* Custom MATLAB code for the calculation of [Phase Amplitude Coupling (PAC)](http://neurofractal.tumblr.com/post/137022821953/phase-amplitude-coupling-pac-a-mechanism-for)
* **[Psychopy](http://www.psychopy.org/) for programming psychology experiments**
* [Eprime](https://www.pstnet.com/eprime.cfm) for programming psychology experiments
* Scientific Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, plotly) for psychology/behavioural data analysis and presentation
